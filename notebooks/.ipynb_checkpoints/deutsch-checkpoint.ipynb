    "<p>The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm was a groundbreaking step because it was the first quantum algorithm that could solve a problem faster than any traditional computer algorithm. It highlighted that quantum computers could be really useful tools for solving certain specific problems. To understand how it did this we'll look at the problem it tackled, the classic solution to it and then going into the quantum soltion </p>"

    "You have a person with 100 hands, each hiding a coin that can be either heads or tails. There are 2^100 possible combinations of outcomes. To figure out if the outcomes are constant (all heads or all tails) or balanced (equal number of heads and tails), you might need to check up to 51 hands in the worst case using a <b> classical computer.</b><br>\n",

    "Now, each hand's result can be seen as applying a function 'f' to a single bit (0 or 1) that gives f(0) or f(1).\n",
    "If f(0) = f(1), then 'f' is constant (all 0s or all 1s); otherwise, it is balanced (equal 0s and 1s).\n",
